# IOT_Assignment
This is a program to scan for and detect the Mac Address on a Network of a specific device. Once the device has been found, 
MQTT publishing has been deployed to send information regarding the devices state to a broke. Telemetry can be implemented
in the form of email notifcation and Twitter notification when the device has been online for a certain amount of time.
Blynk is then implemented to send a message to a raspberry pi sense hat, warning the device user that time has expired.
